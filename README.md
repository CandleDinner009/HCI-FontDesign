# Design of a new font which I call Andromeda

Designing a new font is an interesting challenge through which I had the opportunity to express myself creatively. I learned to create fonts using the metaflop online tool. The font that I created is called Andromeda. The name alludes to its exotic and futuristic design since humans are still a long way off from exploring Andromeda. Most fonts that we use today tend to have soft edges and a larger degree of curvature resulting in a gentler curve. However, this font has a square pen shape with a sharp curve. This type of font is ideally suited for use in futuristic/space-based video games such as Mass Effect or Starfield, giving them an exotic and far-flung aura.
The parameters I used to create this font are as follows:

1) unit width - 0.95
2) pen width - 0.15
3) pen height- 0.6
4) glyph angle - 42
5) pen angle - 20

The unit width has been reduced a bit to give it a compact feel. The pen width has been reduced significantly and the glyph angle increased to give it an alien vibe. The pen angle has been left untouched. Overall, these design decisions create a weird, flamboant style that is not commonly used in day-to-day life, and that's the intent.
